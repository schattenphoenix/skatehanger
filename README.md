# Skatehanger
A hanger for skate sliders (+ designs for sliders)

**Be aware that this is fully WIP, no tests have been conducted so far.**

### What do I need?
The hanger f3d file contains user parameters for the kingpin distance and angle to customize in case you want to create your own size. Apart from that you need the step file (for the bends) and a fitting DXF for the lasercutting.

### Can I sell these?
Parts can according to the license be made for non commercial use (privately, even in bulk for friends).
If you want to sell these parts, **PLEASE** make sure that these have been tested thoroughly in the size you would like to sell them and also **PLEASE** get in touch with me before doing so.
The license is not chosen without reason!
